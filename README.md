## ABOUT

A Full-Stack Engineer with over 8 years of experience designing and developing high performance web applications and scalable services, including 2.2 years as a Team Lead. I have deep expertise in backend development with Java and Spring Boot, as well as frontend development using React. My experience covers system architecture design, database management (Oracle, PostgreSQL), and deployment in AWS and Azure cloud environments. I have successfully implemented CI/CD pipelines, reducing deployment time

Beyond my core expertise, I have implemented features involving low-level graphics and machine learning. Passionate about the evolution of AI, I actively stay current with the latest trends and develop AI Agents as a member of the TokyoAI community, regularly attending its meetups. I am seeking an opportunity to apply my skills to create innovative products within a strong team.
